# xtd

```jsonnet
local xtd = import "github.com/jsonnet-libs/xtd/main.libsonnet"
```

`xtd` aims to collect useful functions not included in the Jsonnet standard library (`std`).

This package serves as a test field for functions intended to be contributed to `std`
in the future, but also provides a place for less general, yet useful utilities.
